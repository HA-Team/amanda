&lt;h2 id=&#34;cisco-pema:1143b47f30f5a9db31dc72cc6e9869c9&#34;&gt;Cisco Pema&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electric bassist Cisco Pema is no new face in the music industry. Growing up in Argentina, he started out in rock bands in Buenos Aires before exploring the diverse world of South American music on the Rio de la Plata. He then settled in Linz, Austria, to study for a Bachelor’s Degree in Jazz Bass. There he founded several hip hop bands and played in numerous reggae projects. Given these eclectic tastes and experiences, it won’t come as a surprise that he later touched down in Europe’s most diverse musical city: Berlin.
His debut album, ‘Cisco Pema,’ accurately reflects his musical versatility. The two Austrian producers, Manuel Mitterhuber and Mario Stadler, have both successfully interpreted Pema’s music, allowing them to bring out the best in his compositions. And the result is a melange of his South American singer/songwriter style and the Berlin electronic sound, not to mention his intermittent appearances as a rapper.
The album presents Cisco Pema’s own journey. In listening, we join the charismatic Argentinian on his night-time journey through Berlin, moving from a samba party to a jazz session; checking out an electronic club before finishing up at a hip hop jam. And at over two meters tall, he is known to move quickly. So be sure to grab hold of him and get him on stage…&lt;/p&gt;
